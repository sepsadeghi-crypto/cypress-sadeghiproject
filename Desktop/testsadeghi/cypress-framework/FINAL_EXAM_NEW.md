## App Setup

```bash
# 1. Install all dependencies
npm run setup

```

To reset the database to its original seed state before running tests:

```bash

```

Or reset and start in one command:

```bash
npm run reset-and-start
```
Once you start the application, you may open your test framework in a separate IDE instance and start writing your tests.
